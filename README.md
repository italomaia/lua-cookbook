# Lua Cookbook

Don't know what lua can do?
Don't know how to do something with lua?

... Well, you've come to the right place!

This project is a collection of Lua solutions for common programming problems.
All examples are compatible with Lua5.3. If there are dependencies, they're
explicitly written in each package.

All problem descriptions were extracted from the book "Python Cookbook" by
Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft and David Ascher, which dive much
deeper discussing solutions for each problem, of course, in Python.
